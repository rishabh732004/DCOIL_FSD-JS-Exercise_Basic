    <h1>JavaScript Condition Exercise</h1>
    <p>Your task is to modify the function <code>numberChecker</code> so that it returns <code>true</code> when the entered number is greater than or equal to 10, and <code>false</code> if it is less than 10.</p>
    <p>Currently, the code checks if the number is equal to 6. You need to change this condition to check if the number is greater than or equal to 10.</p>
    <p>Once you've made the changes, check the result in the Developer Console (Right-click and select "Inspect", then go to the "Console" tab).</p>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> You need to modify the condition inside the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
