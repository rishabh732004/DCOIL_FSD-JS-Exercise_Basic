        // ===== Step 1: =====
        // Look at the code below and make a prediction of what the output will be.
        // After making your prediction, press 'Run' and look at the output in the console.
        // If you were surprised by anything, go back and look at the code to see what's going on.

        const firstName = "rishabh";
        const lastName = "pundeer";
        const thisyear =2024;
        const birthyear =2004;

        const greeting = " hello i am " + firstName + " " + lastName+" and i am "+ (thisyear-birthyear)+ " years old";

        console.log(greeting);

        // ===== Step 2: =====
        // Once you understand the code snippet above, delete it. Then, using the instructions below, recreate the snippet.

        // Your code goes here (after deleting the above code)
        // ---------------------------------------------------------------
        // 1. Create 4 variables: firstName, lastName, thisYear, and birthYear
        // 2. Create a 5th variable, greeting, that is constructed from the previous 4
        //    (it should contain a greeting with the person's full name and their age)
        // 3. Print greeting with console.log
        // 4. Press 'Run' to ensure your code works

    <h1>JavaScript Variables Exercise</h1>
    <p>This exercise involves predicting the result of a code snippet, then recreating it after understanding how it works.</p>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Look at the code and make a prediction about the output in the console. Run the code and check the result.</li>
        <li>Step 2: After understanding the code, delete it and recreate the variables following the instructions in the comments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can use <code>console.log</code> to check your values at any time while working through the exercise.</p>
